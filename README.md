# AI for Sustainable Development - Week 2 Assignment

## 🌍 Theme
**Machine Learning Meets the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**

---

## 📌 Objective
Design a **machine learning model** or **AI-driven solution** that addresses one of the **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**. The solution should integrate concepts from Week 2, such as:

- Supervised/Unsupervised Learning  
- Neural Networks  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Reinforcement Learning

The project should demonstrate how AI can contribute to solving global challenges like **poverty**, **climate change**, or **inequality**.

## 📊 Project Title
*Your AI Solution Title Here*  
*A brief one-line description of the solution*

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Clearly define the real-world issue your AI model addresses and identify the relevant SDG(s).  
For example:
> *"Climate change is leading to irregular crop yields across Sub-Saharan Africa. Our AI solution predicts optimal planting times to reduce food insecurity (SDG 2: Zero Hunger)."*
