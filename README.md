# SDG 13 Article: Leveraging AI to Combat Climate Change ‚Äì A Data-Driven Approach

### Introduction
Climate change is a major global challenge impacting biodiversity, weather patterns, and human livelihoods. AI, especially supervised learning, provides powerful tools for developing predictive models to mitigate these risks.

### Problem Statement 
SDG 13 calls for urgent action against climate change. Uncontrolled CO‚ÇÇ emissions, extreme weather events, deforestation, and inefficient energy use accelerate global warming.

### AI Solution Using Supervised Learning 
1. Extreme Weather Forecasting: AI models trained on climate data can predict hurricanes, floods, wildfires.  
2. Carbon Emission Analysis: Identifies industries with high emission levels.  
3. Energy Optimization: AI-driven recommendations promote sustainable energy use.  
4. Deforestation Monitoring: Deep learning applied to satellite imagery detects illegal clearing.

### Impact of the Project  
By integrating AI solutions, policymakers and organizations can make informed decisions to prevent disasters, reduce resource waste, and support sustainable practices.
